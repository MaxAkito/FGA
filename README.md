Auto-battle app for F/GO (Android 7 or later, no need for Root). Forked from <a href='https://github.com/MathewSachin/Fate-Grand-Automata'>https://github.com/MathewSachin/Fate-Grand-Automata</a>

Main feature of this fork is allowing alternative package name APKs. Specifically copied ones and Better FGO, if you have one you wanted to be added feel free to ask.
